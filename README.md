## feedParserDemo

A demo of Dan MacTough's feedparser package.

### The story

I use Dan's feedparser package in River5, which is my latest river-of-news feed reader. So all my news flows through this package.

It was a little tricky getting started because the package is designed for maximum efficiency at the expense of a bit of ease-of-use especially for a Node newbie. So I pulled out a bit of code from River5 and simplified it so it makes a good demo of feedparser. 

If you're new to feedparser, this might help you get started a bit faster with less head-scratching. :-)

### How to

1. Download the project. 

2. Open the folder in your Terminal app. 

3. npm install

4. node demo.js

You should see a list of item titles from the feed.
